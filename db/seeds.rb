# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# mal = Student.create(first_name: "Malorie", last_name: "Casimir")
# sam = Student.create(first_name: "Sammy", last_name: "Akharaz")
# sam = Student.create(first_name: "Lawrence", last_name: "Hon")
# Student.all.each {|student| student.active = true}
